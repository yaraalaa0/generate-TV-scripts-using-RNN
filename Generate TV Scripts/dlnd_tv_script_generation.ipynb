Luckily there's more data!  As we mentioned in the beggining of this project, this is a subset of [another dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/wcukierski/the-simpsons-by-the-data).  We didn't have you train on all the data, because that would take too long.  However, you are free to train your neural network on all the data.  After you complete the project, of course.\n",
